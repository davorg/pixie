# Pixie the Elf writes Perl

Over the last few years I've written a few blog posts for Perl-related
Advent calendars. Recently, they have been about Pixie the Elf (whose
parents had strange ideas about names).

I thought it would be a good idea to start to collect a list of these
posts, so I can remember where and when they were posted.
